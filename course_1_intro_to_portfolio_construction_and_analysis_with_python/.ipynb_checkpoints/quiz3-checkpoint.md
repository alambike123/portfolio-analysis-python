1.Question 1
Consider the Monte Carlo Simulation we ran for CPPI. Assume there is no floor set (i.e. Floor is set to Zero) As you increase the number of scenarios, which of the following would you expect:
1 point


The difference in terminal wealth between the Worst Scenario and the Best Scenario will INCREASE *


The difference in terminal wealth between the Worst Scenario and the Best Scenario will DEPEND ON THE RISK FREE RATE


The difference in terminal wealth between the Worst Scenario and the Best Scenario will STAY THE SAME


The difference in terminal wealth between the Worst Scenario and the Best Scenario will DECREASE

2.Question 2
As you increase the FLOOR, the WORST CASE scenario will:  
INCREASE

3.Question 3
Assume a non-zero floor that is less than the starting wealth. As you increase mu and keep other parameters fixed, you would expect that the terminal wealth:

INCREASE

4.Question 4
All other things being equal, which of these changes will cause an INCREASE in floor violations

Increase both m and sigma

5.Question 5
All other things being equal, which of these changes will cause an INCREASE in floor violations:

Incresease m and decrease rebal

6.Question 6
All other things being equal, which of these changes will cause in INCREASE in Expected Shortfall
incresease m and decrease rebal

7.Question 7
Parameter changes that increase the probability of floor violations will also tend to increase the Expected Shortfall. This statement is:

true

8.Question 8
A CPPI Based Principal Protection Strategy aims to return at least the invested principal by setting the floor equal to the initial value of the assets. Which of the following is true:

Only when risk free rate > 0

9.Question 9
A CPPI based Principal Protection Strategy with 12 rebals per year can have a zero expected shortfall only if:

$m = 1$

10.Question 10
All other things being equal, A CPPI based Principal Protection Strategy is more likely to have a final negative return if:

Sigma increases
